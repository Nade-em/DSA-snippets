# Stack Data Structure

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. In a stack, elements are added and removed from the same end, known as the top. The most recently added element is the first one to be removed.

## Basic Operations

A stack supports the following fundamental operations:

1. **Push:** Add an element to the top of the stack.
2. **Pop:** Remove the element from the top of the stack.
3. **Peek or Top:** Retrieve the element from the top of the stack without removing it.
4. **isEmpty:** Check if the stack is empty.
5. **isFull:** Check if the stack is full (often relevant in fixed-size implementations).

## Visualization

A visual representation of a stack can be imagined as a collection of elements stacked on top of each other, similar to a stack of plates. The element at the top is the one accessible for operations.


## Use Cases

Stacks are commonly used in various applications, including:

- **Function Call Stack:** Keeps track of function calls in programming languages.
- **Undo Mechanisms:** Supports undo operations in applications.
- **Expression Evaluation:** Helps evaluate arithmetic expressions.
- **Backtracking Algorithms:** Facilitates backtracking in algorithms.

## Implementation

A stack can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. The choice of implementation depends on the requirements and constraints of the specific use case.

### Array Implementation

In an array-based implementation, an array with a fixed size is used to store the elements of the stack. The top of the stack is represented by an index variable.

### Linked List Implementation

In a linked list-based implementation, each element of the stack is a node with a data field and a reference to the next node in the sequence. The top of the stack is the first node in the list.

## Complexity

The time complexity of basic stack operations (push, pop, peek) is O(1), making stacks efficient for certain applications.

Stacks play a crucial role in algorithm design and are an essential concept in computer science.
