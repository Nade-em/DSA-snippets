# DSA Snippets

This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) snippets implemented in various programming languages. The snippets cover topics from the course "Introduction to Data Structures" and include code samples and explanations for better understanding.

## Introduction

### Structured Programming Concepts

Structured programming emphasizes the use of clear and efficient programming structures. It encourages the use of modular design and programming practices that enhance code readability and maintainability.

### Basic Concepts of Data Structures and Pointers

Understanding data structures and pointers is fundamental for efficient programming. Pointers allow manipulation of memory, and data structures provide organized ways of storing and managing data.

### Dynamic Memory Management in C

Dynamic memory management in C involves allocating and deallocating memory during program execution. This section explores the use of functions like `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free` for managing memory dynamically.

### Fundamentals of Algorithm Analysis

Algorithm analysis involves evaluating the efficiency of algorithms in terms of time and space complexity. We discuss the Big-O notation and analyze algorithm efficiency in various scenarios.

### Abstract Data-Types

Abstract Data-Types (ADTs) provide high-level descriptions of data structures and operations. They encapsulate the essential characteristics of data structures, such as stacks, queues, and lists.

## Unit I: Introduction to Data Structures

### Arrays

Arrays provide a contiguous block of memory to store elements of the same type. They offer efficient random access to elements using indices.

### Stack

#### Applications of Stack

Stacks have diverse applications, such as Expression Evaluation, Conversion of Infix to Postfix and Prefix expressions, and the classic Tower of Hanoi problem.

### Queue

#### Types of Queues

Queues follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. We explore different types of queues, including Circular Queue and Double-Ended Queue (deQueue). Priority Queue implementation using arrays is also covered.

## Unit II: Linear Data Structures and Files

### Linked List

#### Types of Linked Lists

Linked lists come in various forms, such as singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists. Each type has its unique advantages and use cases.

#### Applications of Linked Lists

Linked lists find applications in various scenarios, including the implementation of stacks, queues, and circular queues. We also explore polynomial manipulation using linked lists.

### Implementation of Stack and Queues using Linked Lists

Linked lists provide an elegant implementation for stacks and queues. We cover insertion, deletion, search, display, and reversal operations in both single and doubly linked lists.

## Unit III: Sorting and Searching

### Searching

#### Linear Search and Binary Search

Linear search and binary search are fundamental searching algorithms. We discuss their implementations and applications, such as finding the square root of 'n' and finding the Longest Common Prefix.

#### Applications of Searching

Searching algorithms have practical applications, such as finding elements in a dataset, spell checking, and more.

### Sorting

#### Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort

Insertion sort, selection sort, and bubble sort are simple sorting algorithms suitable for small datasets. We discuss their implementations and analyze their time complexity.

#### Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Shell Sort, Radix Sort, Heap Sort

Advanced sorting algorithms, including quick sort, merge sort, shell sort, radix sort, and heap sort, are explored. We analyze their efficiency and use cases.

### File Organization

#### Sequential, Direct, Indexed Sequential, Hashed

Different file organization techniques, such as sequential, direct, indexed sequential, and hashed, are discussed. Various types of accessing schemes are also explored.

## Unit IV: Non-linear Data Structures

### Graph Algorithms

#### Graph Representations and Basic Definitions

Graphs are versatile data structures with various representations, such as adjacency list and adjacency matrix. We explore basic graph definitions and properties.

#### Graph Traversal Techniques

Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) are essential graph traversal techniques. We discuss their implementations and applications.

#### Minimum Spanning Trees, Dijkstra’s Algorithm

Minimum Spanning Trees (MST) are crucial in network design. We cover Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms for MST, connected components, and Dijkstra's Algorithm for Single Source Shortest Paths.

### Trees

#### Binary Trees and Operations

Binary trees are hierarchical data structures with unique properties. We discuss terminology, tree traversals, expression trees, and operations in Binary Search Trees (BST).

#### AVL Trees

AVL trees are self-balancing binary search trees. We explore the rotations involved in maintaining balance in AVL trees.

### Hashing

#### Hash Functions and Techniques

Hashing involves mapping keys to indices using hash functions. We discuss open hashing and closed hashing techniques.
